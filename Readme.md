# **REACT ROUTER: UNDERSTANDING USEPARAMS HOOK**.
React router offers a powerful hook that helps in building React applications with multiple paths. This is known as the useParams hook. The purpose of this tutorial is to explain the meaning of useParams hook, benefits of useParams hook and steps in creating a react application that requires using useParams hook.
### **Prerequisite**:
It's important to have basic knowledge on React routing and JavaScript tools such as Arrays, Objects, Map function, and Destructuring. If you are unfamiliar with the above terms, we recommend you taking some time to learn and acquaint yourself before proceeding to get the best from this tutorial.
## **What is useParams Hook?**
The useParams hook is a React router hook that enables navigating and dynamic render of contents with multiple paths. Ecommerce and Blog apps are example of React applications with multiple paths that require implementing useParams hook. For instance, a blog app contains many blogs with a unique id, which will be used to retrieve and render blog details.
## **Benefit of useParams Hook**
* **Less codes:** The useParams hook align with the **Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY) principle of React framework. With useParams hook, we don't have to write codes for all path. We only need to create a unique id, retrieve and render its content.
* **Quick production:** When less codes are written, we finish our project as quick as possibles.
* **Saves time:** useParams enables easy coding which saves time and energy both in writng codes and reading to understand codes
* **Accuracy:** The useParams hook avoids the burden of writing unending codes for multiple path, with less codes getting the accurate data.
* **Clean codes:** Implmenting useParams hook makes your codes understandable and maintainable.
## **Steps in applying useParams hook in React applications.**
In this section, we shall be building an ecoomerce page that display products, whereby each product details will be retrieve and render. Letâ€™s get started.
### **Assumption**
This section will assume that you have setup your react app with necessary routings. If you have not, check out this [**Link**](/https://medium.com/@nehemiahdauda60/routing-in-react-applications-96340f2b07d5.) to setup your React application including installing React-router-dom. Also to note, the above link will serve as reference as we start building this app.

Firstly, lets creates an image folder in src directory. Insert all necessary images needed for the project.
* Creates route in App.js file for our pages.
```
<Routes>

    <Route path='/product/:id' element={<StoreDetails />}></Route>

</Routes>
```
The created route path has a placeholder as **id** in front colon. What the placeholder does is that react router will dynamically match the route to a url that matches /product/:id pattern in its path. For instance, if a url path takes in an id of 1, the url path will be product/1.
* Next Creates Product.js file in components folder, containing products informations in an array. Each product should have a unique Id that represent our parameters. Codes below
```
const Products = [
    {
        id: 1,
        title: "Products Name",
        description: "Product description",
        image:  require('../images/product-1.png')
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        title: "Products Name",
        description: "Product description",
        image:  require('../images/product-2.png')
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        description: "Product description",
        image: require('../images/product-3.png')
    }
]

export default Products;
```
* Next, creates a Card.js component, iterates through products in Product.js file using map function and render all products.
```
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import Products from "./Products";

const Card = () => {


    const arrayDataItems = Products.map(store =>{
        const {id, title, description, image} = store;
        return(
            <div key={ id } className="card">
                <img src={image} alt=""></img>
                <h3>{title}</h3>
                <p>{description.slice(0, 100)} <Link to={`/product/${id}`}>see more</Link></p>
            </div>
        )
    })

    return (
        <>
            <section className="card-section">
                {arrayDataItems}
            </section>
        </>
    );
};

export default Card;
```
In the above codes, map function was used to iterates through products which was imported from Products.js file. We also destruture our products object and save it to store. Note also we have a Link element that points to a url using using backtick ( **`** ) and template literals ( **${}** ).
* In Home.js file in pages folder, import and render Card.js as seen in the codes below. (reference from [**React routing tutorial**](/https://medium.com/@nehemiahdauda60/routing-in-react-applications-96340f2b07d5.) )
```
import Card from "../components/Card"

const Home = () => {

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Home Page</h1>
            <Card />

        </>
    )
}

export default Home;
```
* Creates ProductDetails.js file in pages folder, import and implement useParams hook from react-router-dom.
```
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import Products from "../components/Products";

const StoreDetails = () => {
    let { id } = useParams();
    const productDetails = Products.find(productDetails => String(productDetails.id) === id);

    return (
        <>
            <section key={id} className="details-section">
                <img src={productDetails.image} alt=""></img>
                <div>
                    <h3>{productDetails.title}</h3>
                    <p>{productDetails.description}</p>
                </div>
            </section>
       </>
    )
}

export default StoreDetails;
```
We firstly destructure our id and assign it to useParams function. Next, the find method assign to productDetails is use to match the id to and retrieve its content, which can further be render.
* Style your components in index.css file. i gave mine some little styling.
```
.card-section{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
  margin: 40px;
}

.card{
  padding: 1.2rem;
  border: 1px solid rgb(104, 101, 101);
}

.details-section{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 30px;
  margin: 90px;
}
```
* Run server and see outcome.

In conclusion, this document provides a comprehensive knowledge on useParams hook. We looked at the benefits of useParams hook and also the process in applying useParams hook in react applications.
